### Welcome to viewfAInder

First of all, allow me to apologize for the possibly worst project name ever ðŸ¤£.

The app is a playground for AI related features on Android. It uses Gemini to analyze images. Therefore, to run the app, you need to add an API key to the *local.properties* file.

***Please note:*** Google Cloud credits are provided for this project.
